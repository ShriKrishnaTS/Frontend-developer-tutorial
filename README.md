Hi Friends, 
 My name is Krishna,full stack developer working with a private firm as a software developer. This is my prominent try to teach/guide or act as a resource for all the budding frontend developers out there! This course is majory ispired by a lot of online paid/free courses and tutorials I read growing as a developer. I have handpicked the basic, important and latest topics from most of the courses and tutorials available and handcrafted the syllabus keeping beginers in mind. 
 The pattern followed in the entire course is something similar to ELI5 (explain like I'm 5) All the topics here are basically structured in an HTML so that the users can read and learn the bassic structuring while I strenghten my basics. Yay. the idea is to learn while teaching :) 
 Hence, one can observe that the topics and lessons in this tutorial has no styling. The styling has been introduced to lessons once the user gets to know the basics of HTML and steps in to learn CSS. Then comes the Javascript. As mentioined, this is a learn and teach approach and thus the pattern. 
 We do not write any code in the first couple of introductory files in this tutorial. These are purely for the sake of knowledge that any one who has a desire to become a front-end developer must possess
This is exactly how I started my development carrier. Learning line by line, chapter by chapter and finally trying to contribute atleast the basics of front end for the aspiring developers out there.
