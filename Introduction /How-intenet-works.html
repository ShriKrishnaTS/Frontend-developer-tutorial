<h1> How internet works? </h1>
<p> Have you ever wondered what happens if you type www.facebook.com on your browser? How does the internet fetch the appropriate page for you?</p>
<p> Well, it is a huge process behind the scenes. To put it in simple words theoretically follwoing is the list of actions carried in order to fetch the results for you</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your computer packs a request in an virutal envelope called packets wrapped with specific information </li>
	<li>Your computer then sends this request in the form of packet to the server of the website. Your computer sends a request to send a copy of that particular webpage (to put it simple) </li>
	<li>The server reads the request</li>
	<li>The server cannot serve the response as it is. i.e the server cannot send response of the entire webpage as it is along with all the images of the page. Instead it breaks the response into thousands of smaller packets and responds to your computer </li>
	<li>Your computer/browser receives these packets and rebuilds these packets to a human readable format</li> 
	<li>You can always view what the server has sent to your computer/browser along by inspecting the source of your webpage</li>
</ul>

<p> <b><i>Note</i></b> We do not write any code in the first couple of introductory files in this tutorial. These are purely for the sake of knowledge that any one who has a desire to become a front-end developer must possess</p>
<p> <b>PS: </b> This is a plane HTML page with no styling. I know it looks a bit odd. But we are not aware of anything yet other than the basis of HTML. on't lose your patience. Kindly read on</p>
