<h1> How the right request is sent to right server? </h1>
<p> As mentioned in the previous chapter, when you type in an URL on your browser, your browser wraps a request in an virtual envelope and sends it to the server which responds with the appropriate data and user can see the results. But how does your browser send a request to the right server? How does your browser gets to know the exact server the request has to be sent? </p>
<p> Well, here is the ansewer for you</p>
<ul>
<li>Your query is submited to your ISP</li>
<li>Within your ISP, the DNS takes the domain name and turns it into an IP address</li>
<li>A request is now sent to desired IP via HTTP</li>
<li>Request finds the fastest possible path to server</li>
<li>The server in turn figures out exactly what is asked for and builds the right condent by pulling out from the database</li>
</ul>
