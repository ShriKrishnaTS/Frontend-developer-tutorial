<h1>Developer Environment</h1>
<p> For any developer, it is most important to be in a right developer environment. Developer environment refers to the procurement of all the necessary tools, editors, browsers etc before diving deep into development mode (Trust me, development mode is a super natural power for any developer, powerful than the beast mode :) ) </p>
<p> A front-end developer would require two tools to develop a webpage. 
	<ul>
		<li>Browser</li>
		<li>Editor</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p><b><i>Browser - </i></b>	This is to view the webpage that you code using an editor. There are n number of browsers available. As per the recent study, chrome has the highest number of users and I personally recommend you to use this browser if you are not used to it. We will be using the chrome web browser in this tutorial
</p>
<p><b><i>Editor -</i></b> This is a software to write your code. You can use any editor available today such as, notepad, notepad++, gedit(linux users), sublime text, rubymine, atome etc. I personally recommend users using sublime since it has all the required advanced features. Also, it is available for free download. You can find a liscece key on github and use this editor for lifetime without any worries </p>
<hr>
<p> <b><i>Note</i></b> We do not write any code in the first couple of introductory files of this tutorial. These are purely for the sake of knowledge that anyone who has a desire to become a front-end developer must possess</p>
<p> <b>PS: </b> This is a plane HTML page with no styling. I know it looks a bit odd. But we are not aware of anything yet other than the basis of HTML. on't lose your patience. Kindly read on</p>
