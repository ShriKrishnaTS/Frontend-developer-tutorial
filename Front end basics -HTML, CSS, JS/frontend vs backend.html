<h1>What is the difference between frontend and backend</h1>
<p> "Front-end" typically means the parts of the project a user interacts with--such as the graphical user interface or command line. It's a vague term, there isn't an exact definition. "Back-end" means the parts that do the work, but the user is unaware of or cannot see. Databases, services, etc. </p>
<p> Basically, HTML, CSS are the best examples for frontend while everything else such as servers, database are the examples for backend</p>

<h2>The Restaurant Analogy: Front-end Vs. Back-end Development</h2>
<h4>The Front-End (Client-Side)</h4>
<p>Imagine walking into a restaurant and being cheerfully greeted by a hostess. She hands you a beautifully designed menu explaining your options as she escorts you to your immaculate table. When your food arrives, it is perfectly cooked and carefully arranged on your plate. The entire presentation has been optimized for your experience, and the details of the preparation are not exposed to you.</p>
<p>
This is analogous to the front-end code you see when you visit a polished looking website or open the Uber application on your phone and notice its clean look and feel. The front-end has to communicate with the back-end at key points to relay data (like when the waiter takes your order back to the kitchen), but the front-end is primarily responsible for powering the presentation of that data to the client (your web browser or phone). Front-end code you see on a website is almost always going to be a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In a mobile application, it might be JavaScript, Swift, iOS, or Java.</p>
<h4>The Back-End (Server-Side)</h4>
<p>Returning to our place at the table, imagine you’ve just told the waiter what you’d like to order. The waiter has written your request on his notepad, and he’s now walking into the kitchen, soon to be hidden from your view. If you could see inside the kitchen, you’d see the waiter clipping your order details onto a line. Nearby, flames on a grill are searing a row of burgers, and a head chef is commanding the operation, delegating tasks to her line cooks. Preserved food is brought out of from the refrigerator, prepared, and finally plated. When it’s ready, the plate is finally brought back out of the kitchen to the customer, who has no idea what went on behind the swinging doors, but sure is pleased with the result.</p>
<p>Working in (or being in charge of) the kitchen is what it’s like to work on back-end code. Your work powers the business, and you have to be concerned with challenges like data storage (the coding-world version of a refrigerator) and load handling. How many servers (chefs) need to be available in times of peak traffic? How can infrastructure costs be minimized when you’re off-peak? How can communication with the front-end be optimized? These are the questions the back-end engineer learns to answer.</p>

<p> <b><i>Note</i></b> We do not write any code in the first couple of introductory files of this tutorial. These are purely for the sake of knowledge that anyone who has a desire to become a front-end developer must possess</p>
<p> <b>PS: </b> This is a plane HTML page with no styling. I know it looks a bit odd. But we are not aware of anything yet other than the basis of HTML. on't lose your patience. Kindly read on</p>
